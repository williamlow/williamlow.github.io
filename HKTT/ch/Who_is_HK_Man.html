<h2> Who is <span style="color:var(--main-accent-color)">HK Man</span>?</h2>

<p>I don't know! Do you?</p>
<p>HK Man is a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/old-hk/">Flickr user</a> who built this collection of then-and-now photographs. The earliest photograph in the collection is dated January 2007, and the last October 2011. His account is no longer in use, and efforts to contact him through Flickr and an email address listed in his profile have failed.</p>

<p>These images form a valuable record of architectural change in Hong Kong. Changes to Flickr’s allowance means that some of these images will soon be lost. In response to this, and a fear that the collection could one day disappear altogether, they have been saved and uploaded here. My hope is that in a few decades time someone repeats these photographs for a third time and adds them to the collection.</p>

<p>I would love to get in touch with HK Man, to talk about his project and methodology behind it. If you know who he might be, or if you yourself are HK Man, please <a href="About_Contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
