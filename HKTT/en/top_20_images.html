<h2> <span style="color:var(--main-accent-color)">Top Twenty </span>Images </h2>

<p>Just want to see the best? I've picked out twenty of my favourite image pairs from the collection.</p>


<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/土瓜灣 - 海心公園 3762393926.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Hoi Sham Park<br>Unknown date and July 2009
  <p>Probably my favourite set of all: aesthetically pleasing and captures the changing city skyline. The additional boulders have made lining the new shot up a problem - I'd love to know if HK Man took any at a slightly lower angle.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/上環 - 德輔道中、林士街 交界 5167357142.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Sheung Wan, Junction of Des Voeux Road Central and Rumsey Street<br>Post-war and Nov 2010
  <p>This pair of images really captures the transformation of Hong Kong: the dramatic and total change in architecture, and the explosion of towers in the distance. But the much-beloved tram provides some continuity between the two images.
  </figcaption>

</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/中環 - 上亞厘畢道、雅賓利道 1964 5209343609.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Upper Albert Road and Albany Road<br>1964 and Nov 2010
  <p>This set shows the intense three dimensionality that I love about Hong Kong. The red and white colour scheme of taxis visible in both images endures today, and inspired the colours of this website.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/九龍城 - 東頭村道、東正道 交界 3098174924.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Kowloon Walled City, at the junction of Tung Tau Tsuen and Tai Shing roads<br>c.1970s and Dec 2008
  <p>This area of shops and housing on the left was part of Kowloon Walled City. The Walled City was an incredibly dense urban enclave that was essentially self-policing. A maze of alleyways between inter-connected high rise buildings, it was crammed with cheap housing and unregulated businesses. The site was finally cleared in 1994 and is now the home of a park. There's a brilliant book about it by photographer Greg Girard called City of Darkness.</figcaption>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/中環 - 雲咸街、威靈頓街 交界 1874 4250863305.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Wyndham Street and Wellington Street junction<br>c.1874 and Jan 2010
  <p>This is one of the oldest images in HK man's collection. The sign on the left is for the Hong Kong Photographic Rooms, a studio where customers could have portraits taken, or buy prints of scenes of Hong Kong. The original owner was an Emil Riisfeldt, who soon after left for a career in Australia. Unfortunately the negatives of his Hong Kong photography have not been found.</figcaption>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/半山 - 羅便臣道 103 號 3973783419.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>The Panorama Gardens apartment building, Robinson Road<br>Unknown date and Sept 2009
  <p>HK man called this collection '香港在消失ing': Hong Kong is disappearing, and lamented the loss of the many old buildings of the city. He felt that the city was losing its special character, and beginning to look like every other city. Certainly some of his collection make it hard to disagree.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>


<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/中環 - 皇后大道中 4156000157.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>The Central Market<br>Unknown date and Dec 2009
  <p>The old central market buildings was replaced in 1937 with the Bauhaus style building we can see here. It was then closed in 2003, to be destroyed to make room for high rise buildings, but protests won out and the building was granted protected heritage status. It's now undergoing redevelopment, though it's unclear what the future plan for the building is.</figcaption>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/九龍城 - 太子道 5099920094.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Price Edward Road, West<br>Date unknown and Oct 2010
  <p>Quite the dramatic contrast here. Note the church has survived the intervening years, and peeks out from behind the new apartment building.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/堅尼地城 - 加多近街、吉席街 交界 3694167263.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Kennedy Town, now the junction of Cadogan Street and Catchick Street<br>Possibly around 1920 and July 2009
  <p>Another complete transformation, with only the tram lines providing continuity between the two eras.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/山頂 - 山頂道 3846150906.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>The Peak Tower<br>70s or 80s and August 2009
  <p>I love the science fiction styling of the original peak tram building. Thankfully they replaced it with something almost as unusual in shape.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/山頂 - 纜車總站 1890 3844786985.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>The Peak Tram<br>1890 and August 2009
  <p>An even older image of the tram. As an integrated part of the public transport system it also has the red and white branding.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>


<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/油麻地 - 渡船街 c.1972 5857278261.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Ferry Street, 1972 and Jun 2011
  <p>An excellent example of land reclamation in the city. The people living in the apartment building must have been disappointed in the change of view. The building also as an interesting and distinctive lean.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/鰂魚涌 - 英皇道、船塢里 交界  1980年 5424857141.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>King's Road and Shipyard Lane, Quarry Bay<br>1980 and Jan 2011
  <p>Another example of human reconfiguration of Hong Kong's landscape: the hill in the older image was completly removed in the 1980's, making way for the white apartment buildings in the newer photograph.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/尖沙咀 - 天星碼頭巴士總站  c.1966 5696555861.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Star Ferry Bus Station, Tsim Sha Tsui<br>1966 and May 2011
  <p>While the bus station remains the same, the skyline behind it has changed dramatically.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/灣仔 - 修頓球場 1963-65 4097820651.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Wan Chai sports ground<br>c.1964 and Nov 2009
  <p>A great image showing how the residential architecture of the city has changed.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/上環 - 樓梯街、四方街 交界 4510742759.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Square Street<br>1960 and Apr 2010
  <p>HK Man also used stills from films - this colourful scene is taken from 1960's The World of Suzie Wong. The colour scheme of the building seems to have survived, perhaps coincidentally.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/屏山 - 聚星樓 6124555475.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Tsui Sing Lau Pagoda<br>Unknown date and Sept 2011
  <p>This is the Tsui Sing Lau Pagoda - the oldest surviving pagoda in Hong Kong.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/沙田火車站 1976 3739611832.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Sha Tin Station<br>1976 and Jul 2009
  <p>The first big renovation to Sha Tin was in 1980, preparing it for electric trains. A few years after that a large shopping centre was built on top of the station - Citylink Plaza.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/牛頭角 - 牛頭角道  1955-57 3124250848.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Ngau Tau Kok Road<br>c.1956 and Dec 2008
  <p>The intervening 55 years have completely changed the atmosphere of the area of these two images. The sign on the right in the older image reads 'Proposed site for government primary school'.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="figureFullFrame">
<figure>
  <p><img class="top10image" src="../files/photos/鑽石山 - 大老山隧道工程 3651087308.jpg"
    alt="Image">
  <figcaption>Southern entrance to Tate's Cairn Tunnel<br>Date unknown and Jun 2009
  <p>Most of the collection is made up of street scenes, but there's also some great wide angle images like this. Most evident here is the transformation of the low rise housing into parkland, and the expansion of the high rise buildings. I'd be particularly fascinated to see this scene again in a few decades.</figcaption>
