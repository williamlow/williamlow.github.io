  <h1>About the project</h1>
<p>I created these then-and-now photographs as part of a 2018 artist residency at the Linden Centre, a hotel and cultural organisation based in Xizhou, near Dali in Yunnan Province, China. The originals were taken by C.P. Fitzgerald and Joseph Rock in the early 1900s, and I took the modern equivalents from the exact same perspecives.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.linden-centre.com/" target="_blank">Linden Centre</a> occupies several beautifully restored national heritage sites. Besides being a really lovely hotel, the centre runs lectures and workshops on local history, and visits to historical and cultural sites. It is a truly unique experience, and I'm hugely grateful for the time I spent there. Besides these images, I also completed an interactive digital timeline of Dali and Yunnan's history, and an article on the shared history of Yunnan and Myanmar (Burma).</p>

<p>That article forms part of my work on <a href="http://www.yangontimemachine.com" target="_blank">Yangon Time Machine</a>, a long running project based on the capital of Myanmar. There I use similar then-and-now photography, along with articles on the buildings captured and how their history ties into that of the city and country as a whole. If you enjoy this style of photography, or are interested in Yangon, I hope you'll take a look.</p>

<p>Since I try to take updated photographs in exactly the same location as the original, it's hard to know how many images can be completed. Fortunately several key photographs were replicable, and I was particuarly excited to be able to perfectly recreate a scenic view of Dali from a hillside temple. Sadly, some temporary restrictions on access to the city walls and central tower meant that some other great shots could not be repeated. I've included some of those near-misses here.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom:20px">I hope you enjoy these images. The other outputs of the residency can be seen <a href="Linden_center_artist_residency.html">here</a>, and other projects <a href="http://www.williamlow.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Dali Old Town</h2>
		<h4>J.Rock, 1922</h4>
		<p>Beginning with my favourite pair of photographs, I was delighted to get this long distance shot, with the city walls and surrounding hills lined up so cleanly. These images were taken from a temple complex in the hills to the west of Dali.</p>
		<p>These images show the rapid expansion of the town, the persistence of the city walls and rivers, and the build up of urban areas around the lake.</p></div>

		<h2>The Three Pagodas</h2>
		<h4>J.Rock, 1922</h4>
		<p>These pagodas were built in the 9th and 10th Century, and have since endured fires and earthquakes, including the infamous 1925 earthquake that destroyed much of Dali Town. They also survived the Cultural Revolution, during which the temple complex around them was destroyed.</p>
		<p>Trees now mostly block the two smaller pagodas, but the hills behind them helped line the images up wonderfully.

		<h2>Wuhaulou Tower</h2>
		<h4>C.P.Fitzgerald, ~1936</h4>
		<p>This is the central bell tower of Dali, the Wuhualou. The primary landmark inside the city, it was apparently rebuilt like this in 1998 - though I'm unsure of what condition it was in before then. The new style is more elegant and less fortess-like, but to my eye a little less dramatic.</p>
		<p>Access to the upstairs area was closed for some reason, which unfortunately prevented me from getting other interesting photographs.</p></div>

		<h2>The South Gate</h2>
		<h4>Unknown, ~1930</h4>
		<p>Dali was an early focus for tourism in Yunnan, and was a slightly sleepy destination for international backpackers. With the growth of domestic tourism in China, it now receives huge numbers of visitors as an official 'tourism city'.</p>
		<p>I couldn't line this image up perfectly due to a new building behind me, but you can see that the building on the right of both images may actually be the same.</p></div>

		<h2>Trinity Church</h2>
		<h3>C.P.Fitzgerald, ~1936</h3>
		<p>Other religions besides Buddhism also have a long history in the region, and Dali's old town has multiple churches and mosques. Trinity church is Catholic, and like most religious buildings has been adapted to reflect local architectural styles.</p>
		<p>Little has changed in this scene in the last 100 years. The buildings around the church seem to be original, or well restored if not.</p></div>

		<h2>North Gate</h2>
		<h3>C.P.Fitzgerald, ~1936</h3>
		<p>I wasn’t particularly happy with my modern photograph in this set, but I’ve included it as the difference between the two images is so striking. We’re outside the city walls, looking at the north gate along what looks like a rough track for people and mules. Nothing original remains today – the gate and tower have been replaced, and the area is now part of the northern sprawl of the town.</p>
		<p>The old city walls are overgrown with greenery, and makes me imagine how nice this could look today if done in a controlled way. The area outside the walls is also much wilder – I would guess that the wall on the left is part of a house that is also partly overgrown.

		<h2>Little Putuo, Erhai Lake</h2>
		<h3>C.P.Fitzgerald, ~1936</h3>
		<p>This island temple sits on Erhai Lake, to the east of Dali. It's a beautiful expanse of water, and the local fishing is famous for its traditional use of trained comorant birds, which catch the fish, but can't swallow them due to a ring placed around their neck.</p>
		<p>This island, 'Little Grape', is the smallest on the lake, and like the larger temple to the south of Dali is dedicated to the Buddhist figure Guanyin. The temple seems to have been renovated and the island has been extended. Of most interest to me was the difference in water level. This probably isn't seasonal, but caused by climate change or diversion of water.</p></div>

		<h2>Shaping village</h2>
		<h3>Unknown, ~1930</h3>
		<p>It took a long time to work out this photograph - I couldn't understand where the lake had gone! Fortunately some villagers helped me understand that the bridge in the first image had become this concrete track. You can also just see a cleft in the far left hill visibly matches - probably a river.</p>
		
		<p>Just to the north of Dali, Shaping sees regular visitors from Dali for its local market. It's nicer than this slightly ugly image makes it appear, but it is a little sad to see how picturesque it once looked.</p></div>

		<h2>Longwei Gate, Xiaguan</h2>
		<h3>C.P.Fitzgerald, ~1936</h3>
		<p>To the south of the old town is the modern city centre, refered to as Xiaguan or Dali New Town. Both the new and old towns are technically part of Dali city, which can be a bit confusing. Tourism focuses on the old town, but as this image shows there are some really nicely preserved parts of the new town to explore.</p>
		<p>Again, the nearby hills are a delight to line up, and though the tower has been renovated it has a similar footprint. It also looks like some of the buildings are original, particularly those on the right of the image.</p></div>

	<h2>And the ones that got away..</h2>
	<p>Recreating these photographs can be challenging, with new buildings often blocking the original views. In other cases there wasn't enough continuity to line up the photographs, and some temporary restrictions on access to the city walls and central tower prevented others. One day I'd love to return to complete this unfinished business. I've included some of these near misses here.</p>

One day I noticed an empty shop in the tower had an open door. I took a gamble and snuck upstairs, but there was no roof access. Foiled! I fled before waking up the sleeping worker I noticed in the corner of the room.</p>
			<p>It’s a shame this didn’t work out, as the view of the main street in particular would be fantastic to compare over the years.

Unfortunately it turns out the land here is still military owned, and so I wasn’t able to access it. They actually take up a rather large portion of the old city – valuable land in such a heavily touristed site. You can see this area shaded red on the map below.</p>

		<h2>Aerial view of the old town</h2>
		<h3>C.P.Fitzgerald, ~1936</h3>
		<p>I spend a long time trying to figure out how this photograph was taken. We’re looking across the city from outside and above the city walls. You can see the white face of the Wuahualou tower in the middle. But no tower seems to have reached this high, and the hills are too far to create this view, even with a zoom lens.</p>
		<p>One potential explanation is the white glare on the left of the photo, which may be from a window. Perhaps the photograph was taken from inside a plane flying over the city?</p>
